### Rose
Learning how to talk to LLMs is particularyl important for my research as I am using Claude to write code for me. So even the way that Claude writes the code can be adjusted so that the script generates something that is more visual (ex. progress bars), you can also ask Claude to explain what does the parameters mean and how to easily adjust them. So the instructions of your project, when having a paid version, the way that you ask LLMs to do the task for you, all of that, will make the collaboration a space for learning as well. Instead of just asking it to do the work for you. 

### Thorn
I don't see any way in which this is not applicable to my research. I just wish we could go much more in depth on ways of talking to LLMs. 

### Bud
Learning how to collaborate and use my preferred LLMs as an assistant that works with me and that expands my limitations, instead of just abusing it for everything.
