### Rose
Understading exactly what a virtual environment is, seeing the different options of how to create one, knowing how to use them and when was really useful information that applies directly to my research. 

### Thorn
What doesnt apply to my research directly is making a script, or virtual environment reproducible along with a publication paper. Most of the students in this Fellowship work on papers, so I understand why they would also want to show the data, the code and make it reproducible for others to proof and also to use in their own research. This doesnt directly apply to me as my projects are in a different area. I would use coding to make a video or photo prints. It would be hard to make this accesible while also making accesible the coding behind it. Also, most people wouldnt be interested in this part, they would only watch the final result. I hope this makes sense, I feel that the methodologies of researchc (science & art) can be quite similar in some cases but the final publication is very different. 

### Bud
Creating virtual environments in a unique folder and maybe even a unique SSD for each project that I develop with creative coding.
