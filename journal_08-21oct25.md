### Rose
It was really interesting to learn about this computer that is available for students. I heard some stuff about it but now I know what it is and how it works. I dont think I need for my research though. 

### Thorn
I dont believe the processes that I do require such a high computing power. Maybe for a very specific work in the future but by that time I will be done with my MFA. We have a really powerful computer at the School of Art and that is more than what I need. 

### Bud
Maybe for a project in the future. At least I will have some information about what it is and how it can be applied for research.
