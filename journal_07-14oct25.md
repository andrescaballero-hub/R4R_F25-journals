### Rose
I dont immediately find a connection on how this can be useful for my research. Until the very end I realized that I have been using containers withouth knowing. By collaborating with someone for the Data Science department, he has been creating this tools in CYverse that convert LiDAR files into images and videos. This by using the Cyverse apps. For me, this is a clear example of a container and how they work. It was until Michele presented Jeffs example with LiDAR that I connected the dots into Cyverse. In that sense, this lesson and others in the past have been really useful to understand some of the tools that I have already been using but perhaps I couldnt explain what they were and how they were functioning. 

### Thorn
I dont see myself making a container and sharing that to the world. Maybe that would be the case of someone that has a specific tool or a large project with a big database that could be useful to share. I feel like my research is different in that way, the container is not as important but the final result and its presentation through an "artistic" project takes center place. 

### Bud
Potentially, I am already using containers in some ways, so they are really useful tools that I can use, especially when Im collaborating with someone that knows how to use them, build them and make them applicable to some of the tools that Im using. My role here is utilizing them for creative repurpose where they can present a project with a certain aesthetic and with a discourse behind it that can make us reflect about current issues of the world.
