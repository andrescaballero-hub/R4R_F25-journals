### Rose
There were many things that apply to my own research. One of them is the creation of a Data Management Plan to have an efficient and correct recollection of data. In this case the data that I work is photos, videos and sound. This data is the backbone of the project and requires meticulous care through each phase.

### Thorn
There are specific examples of resources you can use for the data recollection or the places that you can upload your data that do not apply to my research. This was also the case for metadata, which by definition is the same metadata that is accesible for photos or videos but the management or the softwares used is what changes the most. 

### Bud
To have a concise and clear data management plan. This could be as simple as a timeline, google doc sheet, cloud folders, physical files, etc. But is definitely something I need to improve at.
