## Rose, Bud, Thorn

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Due Wednesday 10th, 11pm**

### Rose
There were many things that apply to my own research. One of them is the creation of a Data Management Plan to have an efficient and correct recollection of data. In this case the data that I work is photos, videos and sound. This data is the backbone of the project and requires meticulous care through each phase.

### Thorn
There are specific examples of resources you can use for the data recollection or the places that you can upload your data that do not apply to my research. This was also the case for metadata, which by definition is the same metadata that is accesible for photos or videos but the management or the softwares used is what changes the most. 

### Bud
To have a concise and clear data management plan. This could be as simple as a timeline, google doc sheet, cloud folders, physical files, etc. But is definitely something I need to improve at.

## Research Application

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Due Monday 15th, 11pm**

The DMP Tool is not applicable to my line of work, as this seems to be tailored for a different type of data that is not audiovisual resources. In my case, its much more efficient to work with the usual cloud services or physical drives and just finding an organization method where I can easily locate the file that I need.
Although, its still interesting how different projects approach the data management aspect in completely different ways.

## Cohort meetup discussion

[!IMPORTANT]

**Due Thursday 18th, 11am**

This was the first cohort meeting of the Fellowship and it was organized by Karla and myself. We tried to keep it very casual and open with some guiding topics in mind but we were also interested in getting to know each other a little bit better so even if the discussion diverted we didnt try to correct it. One of the main points of discussion, which was of particular interest for me, was the differences between an artistic research and a more science based research. Although they may share similar methodologies, the final publication can differ a lot. One prioritizes the scientific community and also a specifc format needs to be followed such as a citation style. The other one is much more free-form where the "finishing" or ways of presenting is just as important (if not more important) as the data collected itself. This can be done through a public exhibition, which is targeted to people involved in the arts but its also welcoming to the extended community. Therefore the work presented is usually translated into symbols/signs that most people can understand (obviously theres every kinda of exception in this matter). So one of the questions that I had for the cohort is how can you visualize the collected data in a simplified way, through images and/or videos that can be easily digestible and understood? And how can that final presentation change the impact that the research may have?
