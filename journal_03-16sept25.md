### Rose
Learning how to talk to computers is one of the first and most important steps that I need to develop for my research. As this can lead to getting better at coding. My main goal is to get to a point where I can study how computers are able to "see. In conclusion this applies directly to my research in every way.

### Thorn
I think it will be challenging to get profficient with this language. As with any other, this will require lots of practice. I am hoping that we have some time during the sessions or through activities to develop and practice with this language a little bit more. We only touched the basics last workshop so I didnt feel that anything was too complicated to understand. 

### Bud
My main focus is to learn how to talk to computers, LLM ,CyVerse and training AI models. This is the main reasons why Im interested in this fellowship.
