### Rose
Learning how to talk to computers is an essential skill that I need to develop. This is essential for my current research and one of the first and most important steps to get better and coding and understand how computers are able to "see". Which is one of my main focus right now. 

### Thorn
We went only through the very basics, I still have a lot to learn but I dont feel that anything that we reviewed was too complicated. I think as in any language, this requires a lot of practice for it to become more natural. Maybe we can have some exercises or assignments that force me to do this. 

### Bud
Everything about how to talk to computers, LLMs and training my own machine learning model can be applied to my research and is one of my main interests during this fellowship.
