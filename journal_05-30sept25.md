### Rose
This may be applicable in the future where I am writing code and wishing to share some of these results online through a serve like GitHub. Following the Open Science guidelines. 
Or if Im looking to work on a collaborative environment with an online community where we all share our results. 

### Thorn
I still dont see a direct connection between Github and Git and my specific research. I dont think I will use this tool as much. Also, it probably requires a lot of constant use to be familirized with the interface and different tools. We only went through the surface of things that you can do but still, it felt a little overwhelming and I dont think I remember most of it by now. I would have to use the help of an LLM to use it in the future. 

### Bud
The only thing that could potentially be applicable is what I mentioned above. But I dont see any direct application, at least right now, to my research.
